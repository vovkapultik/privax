# Privax

A privacy-focused protocol, enabling secure transactions across multiple blockchains.

## Project Structure

This repository contains several components:

### sol-contracts
Solana smart contracts built with Anchor framework, handling the Solana-side privacy functions.

### evm-contracts
Ethereum/EVM compatible smart contracts built with Hardhat, implementing privacy features on EVM chains.

### circuits
Zero-knowledge proof circuits built with Circom, powering the privacy technology and cryptographic proofs.

### api
Backend API service built with Python, providing endpoints for the application.

### relayer
Service that relays transactions between different blockchains and components of the system.

## Getting Started

Each component has its own README with specific instructions. Navigate to the respective directories to learn more about setup and usage.
